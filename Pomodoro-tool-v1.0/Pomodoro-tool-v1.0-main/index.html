    <!-- Proyecto - Pomodoro Tool v1.0 (pomtool)-->
    <!-- Project in the way of convert myself in Professional Developer.
     Languajes used: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript.
     
     Server used for test: netlify
     
     Origin of the Idea: Idea madurated from a video in youtube made by Argentine Data Engineer Tatiana S.
     Spanish Video named "Metodo para aprender o estudiar cualquier cosa". I started to think about
     to make an web aplication like a tool for my own route of learning using this metodology and
     more utilities. She explained gear the POMODORO Metodology. It was new for me. 
     
     Description POMODORO Metodology:
     . Thes metodoly consist in to separate each resource to study in several modules or chapters.
       For example: If i want to study a book about "Learning Python" of 10 chapters, then i 
       separate this 10 chapters in 10 modules and i'll distribute it in 8 blocks of 25 minutes 
       each one with a 5 minutes of rest between each module. Exception: We need to have a rest of
       10 or 15 minutes each 4 modules passed and not 5 minutes like before. We repite the same
       process. IN this time of 10 or 15 minutes of rest we need to do something diferent like: 
       walk, see the TV, or something else different of study. We return back to study after this
       time of rest.
       Then i'll study all the book in 10 days, or 1 and half week, with 8 modules per day for each 
       chapter, with 5 minutes of rest between each module, and with 10 or 15 minutes of rest each
       4 modules passed.    

    Especifications of my project:
    1.- Make a list with the detailed information of all the books, Curses or Material for to 
        study.
    2.- Make the distribution of total modules to study per each resource detailed in the point 1.
    3.- Define how many modules per day i'll used for each resource.    
    4.- Decide how many hours per day and how many days per week i will dedicate to my study's program.
    5.- Define how many hours i'll destinate to each resource every day or if want to assign the 
        same time of study to each resource.
    6.- Define how many modules is possible to use each day and for each resource taking acount the
        points 3, 4 and 5. 
    7.- The application show the controls for i begin the study every day. controls are: 
       - Begin (Show to me an audible and visual notification)
       - Stop (Show to me an audible and visual notification)
       - Pause (Show to me an audible and visual notification)
       - Reset (Show to me an audible and visual notification)
       - Fix the minutes to each interval of study.
       - Fix the minutes for to rest between each of the first four modules. 
       - Fix the minutes for to rest each 4 modules each day.
       - Show the progress of my study for each resource. (Show to me an audible and visual notification)
       - Establish levels of priority for each resource asigning numbers from 1 (level 1) to ...
